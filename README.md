# How to interact with the TODO APP
Hi! This is a short instruction about how to play with this prototype.
1. Make sure you have index.html, todo_app_function.js, and todo_app_style.css, and they are in the same directory.
2. Open the index.html in the browser
3. Add a TODO item by typing in the text in the white input box on the top, and hit the Add button when you finished. A TODO item cannot be empty.
4. To check off a TODO item, click that item. This should give a check mark before your TODO item, and this TODO item will be highlighted in green.
5. To remove a TODO item, move your cursor to the right end of that item and click the close button.
6. To search for a TODO item, type in the search keywords in the search input box at the bottom of the page. TODO items that do not contain the keywords will be filtered out from the screen.
